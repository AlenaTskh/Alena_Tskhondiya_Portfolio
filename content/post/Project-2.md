This is the laundry-pickup service startup WeWashUSleep project. The company's strategy is to build a vast network in smaller cities. WeWashUSleep already had a strong percentage in 140 locations and recently opened stores in 10 new cities. Additionally, the company has two separate sales regions. For this project I implemented the following tasks:
1) Identify which of the two sales regions in performing better (i.e. outperforms the other in two of the following 3 metrics):
- Average Revenue per city
- Average Marketing spend per city
- Average ROMI(Return on marketing investment) per city
